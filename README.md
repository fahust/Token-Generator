# Token Generator

<!--<p align="center" width="100%"><img align="center" src="./doc/My%20starter%20kit.png?raw=true" /></p>-->

# Description

This project is a personnal utils to generate token with smart contract ERC721 / ERC1155 / ERC20.
Easy build.
Easy deploy.
Easy generation of metadatas tokens with example.

## Prerequisites

1. Latest version of Node to be installed(i recommend NVM, easier to install and possible to work with multiple node versions).
2. Install MongoDB and make sure it is running on default port 27017 (if not then please configure constants.ts and change the connection for mongoDB).

Then, install all packages in project.

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
npm i
```

Install [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) locally, and start local network with them.

```bash
yarn ganache
```

````bash
npm run ganache

## Smart contract built With

## Tests Contracts

We test every function of our contracts in every possible context.
We use **mocha** and **eth-gaz-reporter** to perform our tests and get a visual rendering of the **gas costs** and the price in euros depending on the current network congestion and the price of ethereum.

## Solidity Good Practices


| Ref | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Zero knowledge proof](https://docs.zksync.io/userdocs/) | Accelerating the mass adoption of crypto for personal sovereignty |
| [byte32](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11556/use-string-type-or-bytes32) | Use strings for dynamically allocated data, otherwise Byte32 is going to perform better. Bytes32 is also going to be better in gas |
| [Use uint instead bool](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/39932/solidity-bool-size-in-structs) | It's more efficient to pack multiple booleans in a uint256, and extract them with a mask. You can store 256 booleans in a single uint256 |
| [.call()](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-transfer-vs-send-vs-call-function-64c92cfc878a) | using call, one can also trigger other functions defined in the contract and send a fixed amount of gas to execute the function. The transaction status is sent as a boolean and the return value is sent in the data variable. |
| [Interfaces](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_interfaces.htm) | Interfaces are most useful in scenarios where your dapps require extensibility without introducing added complexity |
| [Change State Local Variable](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/118754/is-it-more-gas-efficient-to-declare-variable-inside-or-outside-of-a-for-or-while) | It's cheaper to to declare the variable outside the loop |
| [CallData](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-8c7e8c38bce) | It is recommended to try to use calldata because it avoids unnecessary copies and ensures that the data is unaltered |
| [Pack your variables](https://mudit.blog/solidity-gas-optimization-tips/) | Packing is done by solidity compiler and optimizer automatically, you just need to declare the packable functions consecutively |
| [Type Function Visibility](https://www.ajaypalcheema.com/function-visibility-in-solidty/#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20types%20of,internal%20%2C%20private%20%2C%20and%20public%20.&text=private%20modifier%20specifies%20that%20this,by%20children%20inheriting%20the%20contract.) |  This is the most restrictive visibility and more gas efficient |
| [Delete Variable](https://mudit.blog/solidity-gas-optimization-tips/) | If you don’t need a variable anymore, you should delete it using the delete keyword provided by solidity or by setting it to its default value |
| [Immutable / constant variable](https://dev.to/jamiescript/gas-saving-techniques-in-solidity-324c) | Use constant and immutable variables for variable that don't change |
| [Unchecked state change](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/optimizing-smart-contract-gas-cost-harold-achiando/) | Add unchecked {} for subtractions where the operands cannot underflow |
| [Use revert instead of require](https://dev.to/jamiescript/gas-saving-techniques-in-solidity-324c) | Using revert instead of require is more gas efficient |
| [Index events](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/8658/what-does-the-indexed-keyword-do) | The indexed parameters for logged events will allow you to search for these events using the indexed parameters as filters |
| [Mythril](https://mythril-classic.readthedocs.io/en/master/about.html) | Mythril is a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts |
| [Slither](https://medium.com/coinmonks/automated-smart-contract-security-review-with-slither-1834e9613b01) | Automated smart contract security review with Slither |
| [Reporter gaz](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-gas-reporter) | Gas usage per unit test |
| [Hyper ledger factory](https://www.ibm.com/fr-fr/topics/hyperledger) | Hyperledger Fabric, an open source project from the Linux Foundation, is the modular blockchain framework and de facto standard for enterprise blockchain platforms. |
| [Chain link](https://docs.chain.link/getting-started/consuming-data-feeds) | Oracles provide a bridge between the real-world and on-chain smart contracts by being a source of data that smart contracts can rely on, and act upon |
| [UniSwap](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/guides/quick-start) | |
| [Reentrancy](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/re-entrancy/) | The Reentrancy attack is one of the most destructive attacks in the Solidity smart contract. A reentrancy attack occurs when a function makes an external call to another untrusted contract |
| [Front Running](https://coinsbench.com/front-running-hack-solidity-10-57d0765d0179) | The attacker can execute something called the Front-Running Attack wherein, they basically prioritize their transaction over other users by setting higher gas fees |
| [Delegate Call](https://coinsbench.com/unsafe-delegatecall-part-1-hack-solidity-5-81d5f295edb6) | In order to update the owner of the HackMe contract, we pass the function signature of the pwn function via abi.encodeWithSignature(“pwn()”) from the malicious contract |
| [Self Destruct](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-hack-smart-contracts-self-destruct-and-solidity) | an attacker can create a contract with a selfdestruct() function, send ether to it, call selfdestruct(target) and force ether to be sent to a target |
| [Block Timestamp Manipulation](https://cryptomarketpool.com/block-timestamp-manipulation-attack/) | To prevent this type of attack do not use block.timestamp in your contract or follow the 15 second rule. The 15 second rule states |
| [Phishing with tx.origin](https://hackernoon.com/hacking-solidity-contracts-using-txorigin-for-authorization-are-vulnerable-to-phishing) | Let’s say a call could be made to the vulnerable contract that passes the authorization check since tx.origin returns the original sender of the transaction which in this case is the authorized account |
